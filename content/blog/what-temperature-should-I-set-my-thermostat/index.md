Trying to decide what temperature to set your thermostat? You are not alone! Your thermostat settings not only affect your comfort, they can have a big impact on your utility bills as well. And while the ideal thermostat setting for your home is largely based upon personal preference, there are ways to achieve a comfortable balance between comfort and energy savings.

Here are some tips on how to find the right temperature setting for your home:

### When you are heating your home...

Regardless of whether you are more interested in comfort or savings, finding that sweet spot on the thermostat may take a little trial and error. A good rule of thumb for energy-saving heating is to set your thermostat at 68° F. For more comfort, try increasing the temperature by 1 or 2 degrees at a time. For energy savings, turn the temperature down 1 or 2 degrees at a time.

### When you are cooling your home...

During the hotter, more humid months, nothing beats the relief of a cool, humidity-controlled home. To find your happy place, try setting your air conditioning system at 78° F for a good mix of comfort and energy efficiency. Then, adjust as needed to find your comfort zone.

### When you want to save energy...

According to the Department of Energy, you can save up to 10% a year on your heating and cooling when you set back the thermostat 7-10 degrees from your normal setting, for 8 hours a day. Do this at night when you go to bed, and during the day when you go to work.

During the heating season: Try turning the heat down and bundling up – wear a sweater or light jacket, fuzzy slippers, etc. Open window coverings to allow natural sunlight in and let Mother Nature help warm your home.

During the cooling season: Try turning up the AC temperature and supplementing with a fan – either a free-standing type or a ceiling fan. Close window coverings to minimize the sun’s warming effect.

All year long: Get a programmable thermostat that can automatically adjust the temperature for comfort when you are home or awake. Some of these models will also “learn” your patterns and automatically adjust to help maintain both comfort and energy savings. And, Wi-Fi® thermostats give you even more flexibility with comfort control from your smartphone, tablet or computer. Our Wi-Fi thermostats must be connected to Wi-Fi for remote connectivity. You need an iOS® or Android® mobile device to use our app.

If you just can’t get comfortable at all after experimenting with the temperature in your home, it might be time to get an expert opinion from your local Carrier HVAC contractor. Your local dealer can analyze your HVAC system to make sure it is operating properly, and make repairs if necessary. That’s a solution most people can get comfortable with!
