In the U.S., we spend 90% of our lives indoors! Spring often means home cleaning, but it can also be a great time to check off some key maintenance tasks to create a healthier indoor space. Here are seven tips to help you welcome a new season in a healthier home.

1. Install carbon monoxide detectors on every floor. Carbon monoxide is known as “the silent killer” and fire departments respond to nine carbon monoxide incidents per hour.

2. Change air filters to help reduce pet dander in the air. 67% of U.S. households are home to at least one dog or cat.

3. Never use lawn equipment in the garage even with the door open. Dangerous concentrations of carbon monoxide can build up in minutes.

4. Leverage natural light to protect the circadian rhythm. The average person spends 1/3 of their life in a bedroom.

5. Remove candles and incense. To reduce airborne particles and fire hazards.

6. Consider a dehumidifier and check for signs of water issues like mold growth, water stains and warping. Relative humidity should be balanced for optimal comfort and health.

7. Scrub springtime allergens out of the air with an air purifier. Consider a whole-home air purifier to help reduce dust, dander and pollen.
