  heading: Indoor Air Quality
  copy: Creating your ideal home environment is more than just controlling the temperature. It's also managing humidity and ventilation, which can dramatically impact your comfort and create a space for whoever you share it with. Your home’s air should be filtered and cleaned with limited volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and pollutants that can affect allergies. Carrier home air quality products give you next-level comfort, so you can breathe cleaner air.
