Heat pumps look and function the same as air conditioners for cooling, but in cool months when heat is called for they reverse operation to provide warmth for your home. An efficient heat pump can do this so effectively some homeowners in warmer climates rely exclusively on these units for year-round comfort. If you live in a colder environment, electric-powered heat pumps are great in combination with your oil- or gas-fueled furnace as a Hybrid Heat® solution, which can result in significant savings on your overall heating costs.

At Knope Htg & A/C, we offer many different kinds of heat pump configurations. The most common is what’s called a split system. This simply means that your solution will have components that reside both inside and outside your home. The heat pump itself sits in your yard like a central air conditioner unit. Inside your home an evaporator coil to convert refrigerant and a blower motor to move the treated air is needed. Often this is a combination of your furnace attached to an evaporator coil, but sometimes, only a fan coil is used for both functions.
