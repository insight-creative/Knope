HYBRID HEAT dual fuel systems deliver exceptional performance by using a heating source that provides its most energy-efficient comfort during moderate heating conditions. As the temperature drops outside, the system automatically switches to your second heating source when that becomes the most economical way to keep your family comfortable.

The HYBRID HEAT® dual fuel system provides an economical solution to the rising uncertainty surrounding utility costs. Comprised of a heat pump, a furnace and a wall-mounted control, these systems deliver maximum energy efficiency by automatically choosing the most economical heating source during moderate heating conditions. Ultimate HYBRID HEAT dual fuel systems combine an Infinity® ICS gas furnace with our Infinity® 19 heat pump to provide soothing, superior comfort during both heat pump and furnace operation. This system is tied together by the Infinity® Zoning Control which is set to a “balance point” that tells it when best to select heat pump operation and when to choose furnace operation based on weather and utility costs in the area.
