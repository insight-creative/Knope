A fan coil is an indoor unit of a heating and cooling system. It controls your home environment by moving air inside your home and can also affect your indoor humidity. As a complement to your air conditioner or heat pump, our variable-speed fan coil units can give you premium comfort and energy-saving performance.With an optional electric heat strip, a fan coil can also provide heat to your home if you live in milder climates.
